        <p>As SuperGirls, our mission is to learn basics of <strong>web-design</strong> and <strong>site making</strong>. With the help of HTML and CSS we
        tried to create a website from scratch! Hope you will like our first site and find it attractive. After an amazing event - Hour of Code,
        now it is our group's 3rd project - <strong><em>How Website Works</em></strong>.</p>
